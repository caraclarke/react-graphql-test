## Before we start the server, let’s quickly understand the main components:

### database: This directory holds all the files that relate to your Prisma database service.

- `prisma.yml` is the root configuration file for the service.
- `datamodel.graphql` defines your data model in the GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). The data model is the foundation for the GraphQL API generated by Prisma which provides powerful CRUD operations for the types in the data model.

### src: This directory holds the source files for your GraphQL server.

- `schema.graphql` contains your application schema. The application schema defines the GraphQL operations you can send from the frontend. We’ll take a closer look at this file in just a bit.
- `generated/prisma.graphql` contains the auto-generated Prisma database schema. The Prisma schema defines powerful CRUD operations for the types in your data model. Note that you should never edit this file manually since it gets automatically updated when the data model changes.
- `resolvers` contains the resolver functions for the operations defined in the application schema.
- `index.js` is the entry point for your GraphQL server.

_From the mentioned files,_ only the application schema defined in server/src/schema.graphql is relevant for you as a frontend developer. This file contains the GraphQL schema which defines all the operations (queries, mutations and subscriptions) you can send from your frontend app.
